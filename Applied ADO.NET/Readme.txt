The sample code attached in this zip file are Visual Studio .NET 2003 solutions. The easiest way to run the sample code, just open the the project or solution file in Visual Studio .NET. 

Chapter 06 has a number of .vb files. To run this code, create a console project in VS.NET and copy and paste the code from vb file to your project.

You can't open ASP.NET related samples direct in VS.NET. The simplest way to open ASP.NET samples is create a sample project on your machine, copy config.web file from your machine to the sample project and open the project (NOT SOLUTION). If any sample is referencing some files with a non virtual path such as c:\.., you need to change that to the path of the file on your machine.
